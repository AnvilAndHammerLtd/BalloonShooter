# BalloonShooter
university level 3 Digital Media and Games Project:

Created a 2D game using C# and the monogame library.

The project’s aim was to develop an educational game that target maths skills for primary school pupils (up to year 6 – age 10-11).


You can use visual studio with the monogame library to set it up. If you want to only play the game then check the InstallationFiles folder
